Soon to be filled in with some Hartshorne text. 

Key idea for this on 3/10: 

If you have a projective plane, defined by meets: points -> lines,
then you can define a NEW set of points:

type_equivalence ppoints = lines

and a new set of lines:

type_equivalence llines = points

in which you swap the role of "point" and "line". We already saw something like this in our 
work on the real projective plane, where I suggested that we could use the type "point" (3-coordinate
homogeneous vector) to represent a line (the "line" defined by "points in the plane orthogonal to the
given "normal" vector). 

With these two "new" types we can define a new "meets" function:

  fun dmeets :: "ppoint \<Rightarrow> lline \<Rightarrow> bool" where
    "dmeets P k = meets k P"

i.e., the "newpoint P" (which is really a line p) meets the "newline l" (which is really a point L)
exactly if L lies on p in our original projective plane. This new function, dmeets, (together with its
domain and codomain) constitutes a projective plane, called the "dual" of the original plane. 

To prove this, we have to (as usual) show the three axioms are true.

be used as the "proof" of the rewritten lemma.

Proven in class the other day. @jackson/spike/seiji/caleb feel free to add your names to this 
since the proof was pretty collaborative.
